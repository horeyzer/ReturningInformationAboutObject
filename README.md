# ReturningInformationAboutObject
Please declare the class Car and define the following fields of this class (with the access modifier private): model, brand, year, price, color, quantity.
Please create a constructor of this class consisting of the previously mentioned fields.
We also create methods to return each of the fields (we use return) e.g.: getMOdel () and methods to set value each of the fields (methods taking a new value in their parameters fields) e.g.: setModel (Sting model).
Additionally, we create a delivery() method (simulating car delivery) and sell() (simulating car sales) which change the value of the quantity field.
The last method we create is the toString() method that returns an object of type String and prints it names of all fields of a given object and their state or value.
We also create another class with the main() method in which:
• we create object of the Car class by using the constructor,
• we call and print what the toString() method passes,
• we call the sell() method
• we print all fields (using the previously declared „get” methods of the object field,
• using the „set” methods we change some fields of the object,
• we call and print again toString() method to notice the changes.
